# King Midas Sound

Edition 1 is the name of the album. Just released about a month ago. It features a collaboration with Fennesz of other collaboration fame, namely with David Sylvian, the king of quiet and zen atmospheres. 

I wonder if these sounds will become classic as time goes by. I might even consider it better than King Midas' last album. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1a18d5f8-ab7a-4cea-9e98-f562e59aa1fc.jpg)
