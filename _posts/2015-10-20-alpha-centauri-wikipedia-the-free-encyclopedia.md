description: 'Alpha Centauri (α Cen), also known as Rigil Kent () or Toliman, is the closest star system to the Solar System at 4.37 ly (1.34 pc). It consists of three stars, the pair Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, Alpha Centauri C-better known as Proxima Centauri-that is probably (but not certainly) gravitationally bound to the other two.'
